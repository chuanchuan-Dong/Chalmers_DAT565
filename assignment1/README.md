Tasks:
1. Which countries have a life expectancy higher than one standard deviation above the mean?

2. Which countries have high life expectancy but have low GDP (note the difference between GDP
and GDP per capita)? Motivate how you have chosen to define “high” and “low.”

3. Does every strong economy (normally indicated by GDP) have high life expectancy?

4. Related to the above question (question 3), what happens if you use GDP per capita as an
indicator of a strong economy as opposed to GDP alone? Explain the results you obtain through
this analysis, and discuss any insights you get from comparing these results to question 3.
